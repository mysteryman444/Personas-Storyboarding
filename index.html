	  <h1 class="title" align="center">Whole Foods Self-Checkout Machines</h1>
		<center><p1 class="text">Self-checkout machines guide users through a process of scanning, bagging, and paying for their items. This condensed kiosk provides shoppers with the instructions and materials needed to complete a purchase without the assistance of store employees. 
      </p1></center>
		<h2 align="center" class="title">Key Features</h2>
		<center><ol class="list">
			<li>A pre-staging area is provided for customers to place their unscanned products. The main screen greets customers with instructions to begin the checkout process by scanning their first item on the blinking red lights.</li>
			<li>A bag staging area is provided to the right of the scanner where users can bag their own items and an electronic bag scale ensures the bag weight matches the weight of the items scanned.</li>
			<li>After scanning their products, users are instructed to complete their purchase by paying through feeding their cash into the bill reader or swiping their card through the credit card reader. </li>
		</ol>

		<h1 class="title">Observations</h1>
		<ul class="text">
			<li>More users gravitated towards using self-checkout machine rather than checking out at a traditional cashier’s counter
</li>
			<li>Individuals immediately began scanning items after approaching the machine and seemed to enjoy a streamlined process of purchasing their items by themselves</li>
			<li>Some users faced issues with main interface blocking further action until a store employee were to review the error that occurred</li>
			<li>Customers appeared mildly aggravated by some actions required employed intervention to resolve, extending their time spent checking out
</li>

		<h1 class="title">Interview Questions</h1>
		<ol class="text">
			<li>What prompts you to choose the self-checkout experience over going to a traditional store clerk to purchase your items?</li>
			<li>What feelings do you have towards using self-checkout machines? Do you wish certain places that don’t have them did or that places that places that do didn’t?</li>
			<li>What difficulties have you encountered with your experience using self-checkout machines?</li>
			<li>In your personal opinion, what is missing from the self-checkout experience? What would you like to see from the future of self-checkout machines?</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 class="title">Responses</h2>
		<ul class="text">
			<li>Shoppers preferred the self-checkout experience over going to traditional store clerks because it allowed them a quicker checkout experience, allowing them to avoid long lines and move at their own pace.</li>
			<li>Customers wished they weren’t continuously slowed down by issues prompted by the bag scale that locked their screen and prevented them from moving forward.</li>
			<li>It was mentioned that errors that could only be resolved by employee intervention were particularly disruptful. Customers felt that having to wait for a store employee to assist them contradicted their reasons for choosing to use the self-checkout.</li>

		<h1 class="title">John Doe</h1>
		<p1 class="text">John Doe is a single male in his mid-twenties with no children who lives alone. He’s constantly bombarded by issues with the bag scale whenever he uses the self checkout machine. Having to speak with a store employee in order to resolve issues with the self-checkout machine scares John as he battles with his social-anxiety. As a working professional, John does his shopping after a long day of work and tries to get the grocery shopping experience over as quickly as possible.</p1>

			<h1 class="title">Sally Walker</h1>
			<p class="text">Sally Walker is a married woman in her forties that lives with her three children and her husband. Sally enjoys going to the grocery store while her children are at school, but she runs a tight schedule and will be late to pick the kids up if there are delays in her shopping experience. Ms.Walker alternates between using self-checkout machines and going through the store clerk depending on whether there's a line or not. She's slow on her feet and not very tech savvy so she encounters a lot of errors looking up her non barcoded groceries and questions whether doing it herself is actually better than just going to a cashier.
